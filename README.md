Spaceship Titanic - Passenger Fate Prediction
This repository contains my solution for the Spaceship Titanic competition hosted on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the voyage of the Spaceship Titanic.

Problem Overview
In the year 2912, the Spaceship Titanic, a passenger liner transporting emigrants to newly habitable exoplanets, encountered a spacetime anomaly near Alpha Centauri. The collision resulted in almost half of the 13,000 passengers being transported to an alternate dimension. Our task is to use the data provided from the shipâ€™s computer system to predict which passengers were affected.

Key Information
Type: Classification problem
Goal: Predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension (1 if transported, 0 if not).
Data: The dataset contains information about passengers, including their age, home planet, destination, and other features.
Approach: A supervised machine learning classification approach is used to predict the fate of each passenger.
Dataset
The dataset includes:

Passenger ID
Home planet
Age, Gender, and other personal details
Cabin details
Destination exoplanet
Whether the passenger was transported to the alternate dimension (target variable)
Tools and Techniques
Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (or similar)
Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
Solution
The solution involves:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between features and target variable.
Modeling: Training classification models to predict the target variable.
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate model performance.
